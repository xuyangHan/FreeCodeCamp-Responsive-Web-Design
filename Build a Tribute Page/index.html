            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Yuan Longping's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Yuan was born at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing at Capital city of China on September 7, 1930 to Yuan Xinglie and Hua Jing. He was the second child of six siblings. His ancestral home is in De'an County, Jiujiang, Jiangxi
                    Province in Southern China. Yuan's mother, Hua Jing and his father, Yuan Xinglie. During the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, he moved with his family and attended school in many places, including Hunan, Chongqing,
                    Hankou and Nanjing.
                </li>
                <li>He graduated from Southwest Agricultural College (now part of Southwest University) in 1953 and began his teaching career at an agriculture school in Anjiang, Hunan Province. He married one of his students, Deng Ze (邓则) in 1964, they have
                    two children, Yuan Ding'an (袁定安) and Yuan Dingjiang (袁定江).
                </li>
                <li>He came up with an idea for hybridizing rice in the 1960s. Since then, Yuan had devoted himself to the research and development of a better rice breed. In 1964, he happened to find a natural rice plant for use in his hybridization experiments
                    that had obvious advantages over other species. Greatly encouraged, he began to study the elements of this particular breed.
                </li>
                <li>The biggest problem by then was having no known method to reproduce hybrid rice in mass quantities, and that was the problem that Yuan set out to solve. In 1964, Yuan created his theory of using a hypothetical naturally-mutated male-sterile
                    strain of rice that he predicted most probably existed for the creation of a new reproductive hybrid rice species, and in two years' time he managed to successfully find a few individuals of such a mutated male-sterile rice that he
                    could use for his research. Subsequent experiments proved his original theory feasible, making that theory his most important contribution to hybrid rice.
                </li>
                <li>Yuan went on to solve more problems than followed from the first. The first experimental hybrid rice species that were cultivated didn't show any significant advantage over commonly grown species, so Yuan suggested crossbreeding rice with
                    a more distant relative: the wild rice. In 1970, he found a particularly important species of wild rice that he ended up using for the creation of a high-yield hybrid rice species. In 1973, in cooperation with others, he was finally
                    able to establish a complete process for creating and reproducing this high-yield hybrid rice species.
                </li>
                <li>The next year they successfully cultivated a hybrid rice species which had great advantages over conventionally grown rice. It yielded 20 percent more per unit than that of common rice breeds, putting China in the lead worldwide in rice
                    production. For this achievement, Yuan Longping was dubbed the "Father of Hybrid Rice."
                </li>
                <li>At present, as much as 50 percent of China's total number of rice paddies grow Yuan Longping's hybrid rice species and these hybrid rice paddies yield 60 percent of the total rice production in China. Due to Yuan's hard work, China's total
                    rice output rose from 56.9 million tons in 1950 to 194.7 million tons in 2017; about 300 billion kilograms of rice has been produced over the last twenty years, compared to the estimated amount that would have been produced without
                    the hybrid rice species. The annual yield increase is enough to feed 60 million additional people.
                </li>
                <li>The "Super Rice" Yuan worked on improving showed a 30 percent higher yield, compared to common rice, with a record yield of 17,055 kilograms per hectare being registered in Yongsheng County in Yunnan Province in 1999.
                </li>
                <li>In January 2014, Yuan said in an interview that genetically modified food would be the future direction of food and that he had been working on genetic modification of rice.
                </li>
                <li>On March 10, 2021, Yuan Longping fell down at his hybrid rice research base in Sanya. On April 7, he was transferred to Changsha, Hunan Province for treatment. At 13:07 on May 22, Yuan Longping died of multiple organ failure at Xiangya
                    Hospital of Central South University [zh] (中南大学湘雅医院). Considered a national hero, tens of thousands of people sent flowers to the funeral home</div>
